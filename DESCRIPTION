Description: The package first builds and cross-validates a linear regression model for a dataset containing the spectral reflectance and organic carbon content of soil samples. The linear regression model uses the reflectance to predict the organic carbon content. The package then uses the predictions from the linear regression model to predict the organic carbon content of a Region of Interest (ROI) data table using its spectral reflectance values.
