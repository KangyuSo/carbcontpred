# carbcontpred

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of carbcontpred is to build and cross-validate a linear regression model for a dataset containing the spectral reflectance and organic carbon content of soil samples, and then use it to predict the organic carbon content based on reflectance.

## Installation

You can install the development version of carbcontpred from [GitHub](https://github.com/KangyuSo/my-GEO712-repository) with:

``` r
install.packages('carbcontpred', repos = "https://github.com/KangyuSo/my-GEO712-repository/tree/main/carbcontpred")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## Install and load the package
install.packages("carbcontpred") 
library(carbcontpred)

## Load the dataset 
ref_dry_avg <- read.csv(ref_dry_avg)

## Create a linear regression model with "Reflectance" as the response variable, "Organic_Carbon" as the predictor variable, 10 folds for the cross-validation, and "Predicted_Organic_Carbon" as the output column
pred_c <- cpred(ref_dry_avg, "Reflectance", "Organic_Carbon", folds = 10, "Predicted_Organic_Carbon")

## View the results
View(pred_c)
```
