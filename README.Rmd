# Main Research Interest

Forest ecosystems provide many essential services such as climate regulation and carbon storage. However, they are endangered by ongoing resource exploitation and climate change. Forest management practices hold massive potential for reducing the atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide but require an intensive assessment of their contribution to enhanced carbon sequestration. Unfortunately, traditional inventory-based forest monitoring practices are time, cost, and labour intensive and impractical at a national scale. 

*Digital twinning* and *LiDAR*^[Light and Detection Ranging] can improve national-scale carbon monitoring by modeling the impact of forest management practices, but it is still new and requires research in integrating process models, state variables, and silvicultural interventions.

The main research interest of Kangyu So is to develop digital forest twins to monitor forest management practices used as nature-based climate solutions. Kangyu is interested in integrating process models and state variables with digital twin modeling to investigate its feasibility for forest ecosystem monitoring. His research will analyse relationships between carbon sequestration and stand parameters estimated from LiDAR, and model these relationships to investigate the impact of forest management interventions on carbon uptake in foliage and woody biomass.

# A Chunk of Code

I chose to write a chunk of code that creates a box plot using data from PlantGrowth, a built-in R data set.

``` r
# Load the data set
data(PlantGrowth)

# View the data set
View(PlantGrowth)

# Install and load ggplot2
install.packages("ggplot2")
library("ggplot2")

# Create a box plot of the PlantGrowth data set comparing dry weight and treatment condition
box_plot <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x = group, y = weight, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot()
box_plot
```

# Folder Structure Explanation

The data table created from loading the PlantGrowth data set is stored in the "Data Table Assets" folder. The box plot created from the PlantGrowth data set is stored in the "Image Assets" folder.

The goal of GEOG 712 is to ...

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
