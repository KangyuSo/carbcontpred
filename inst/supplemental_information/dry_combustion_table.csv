"Costech Analytical Technologies","26074 Avenue Hall, Suite 14, Valencia, California- 91355, USA www.costechanalytical.com","ECS 4010 CHNSO","The sample within tin capsule reacts with oxygen and combust at temperatures of 1700–1800°C. Combustion of sample generates mixture of N2, CO2, H2O and SO2. The gases are separated by gas chromatographic (GC) separation column and are detected sequentially by the TCD (thermal conductivity detector). The TCD generates a signal, which is proportional to the amount of element in the sample."

"PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences","710 Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, Connecticut- 06484–4794, USA www.perkinelmer.com","2400 Series II CHNS/O Elemental Analyzer","Based on the Pregl-Dumas method. Samples are combusted with user flexible mode and gases are separated by frontal chromatography and eluted gases are measured using TCD."
"Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH","Donaustrasse 7 D-63452 Hanau, Germany www.elementar.de","vario Macro, vario Max, vario EL III","Samples are dropped into the combustion tube at user selected temperature up to 1200°C. The use of tin vessels further elevates the temperature up to 1800°C. Complete combustion is ensured with O2 jet injection. Except for N2, other gases are retarded into specific adsorption trap. After TCD signal for N2 is received, adsorption traps are thermally desorbed and the corresponding gases detected with TCD sequentially."
