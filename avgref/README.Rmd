# avgref

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of avgref is to calculate the average reflectance of each soil sample at a given wavelength range. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of avgref like so:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("KangyuSo/avgref")
library(avgref)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## Install and load the package
install.packages("avgref") 
library(avgref)

## Load the dataset 
ref_dry <- read.csv(ref_dry)

## Calculate the average reflectance of the soil samples between the wavelengths 1250 nm and 1450 nm.
ref_dry_average <- avgref(ref_dry, 500, 750)

## View the results
View(ref_dry_average)
```
