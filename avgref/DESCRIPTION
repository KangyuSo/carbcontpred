Description: The package calculates the average value of each soil sample in a data set containing the spectral reflectance of post-dried soil samples collected from the Hudson Bay Lowlands. This calculates the reflectance of soil samples at a given wavelength range, which allows specific spectral regions to be compared with other soil metrics.
